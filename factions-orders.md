- The House of Many Curtains — A loose‑knit empire of parlors, houses, and single‑room fronts that sells comfort, sells gossip, and sells secrets—often all at once. To the city’s magistrates they’re charity, vice, or nuisance depending on the official’s temper. To merchants and nobles they’re convenience. To spies and generals they’re an intelligence service that never sleeps.

- Voices of the Obelisk — Cult that worships the obelisks and claims they hold ancient secrets to unlock the bound timeline.

- The Cult of the Forgotten God — Cult that worships the dead Titans and believes that one day they will return.
- The Luminous Hand — They walk the dark roads to heal any in need—noble or beggar, sinner or saint—believing that every soul, like every star, deserves its chance to shine again.
- Apostles of Ra — Followers of Ramera that were left without a patron when he was imprisoned. They have studied extensively to bring their god back.
