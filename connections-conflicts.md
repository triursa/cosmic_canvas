- Nyxandra is the mother of Coralune and Zoraya.
- Draakhavn, Ardoros, Faran, and Kolarus are on the same plane, Aldoria.
- The Cosmic Railway is a train.
- No God or Kingdom has control over the Cosmic Railway.
- Loryss greatly respects Galindis; she sends mortals to her as gifts.
- Coralune abandoned Kolarus after a betrayal from a mortal; she will not cry for them.
- Lindiskard and Veilway are both deathlike domains.
- Faran and Ardoros are at war with each other.
- Loryss and Orion are in conflict, with Loryss upset that Orion doesnâ€™t allow her predictions to happen on the timeframe she wants. This rift caused Draakhavn to be the way it is.
