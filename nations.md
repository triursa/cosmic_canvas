### Ironhallow

Bordering region between Draakhavn and Kolarus.

- The mountain expanse separating Kolarus and Draakhavn. Inside the mountains are a hollow expanse of caves called Ironhallow. These caves are rich with materials for crafting and are highly sought after and often fought over.
- Kolarus and Draakhavn often dispute over Ironhallow and the precious materials it provides both realms that suffer in such opposite extremes—desert and frozen tundra.
- In the mountains live various stone‑ and mineral‑based creatures, bugs, and moles. There are also rumors of titans that dwell in the depths of the caves, and ancient civilizations that helped advance technology but were lost to unknown circumstances.

### Riteriver
