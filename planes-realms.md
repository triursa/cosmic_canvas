- Lindiskard — Plane of the dead.
- Ardoros — Continent of fervor, love, and rage; ruled by kings and queens of desire and battle.
- The Veilway — A twilight expanse of drifting echoes and half‑remembered dreams, where souls linger and choose whether to fade, return, or wander forever.
- Draakhavn — A continent of great cold. All things, even time, are said to be frozen there; snowflakes hang in the air as if gravity has given up.
- Faran — A dense, lush forest continent with low technology and high magic.
- Kolarus — A desert continent once home to an ancient thriving civilization.
- Umbradi — A plane of stars and shadows.
