### Law of Continuance

Energy and soul cannot be destroyed, only transformed.

### Law of Dissonance

If a god defies their nature, their domain begins to rot.

### The Divine Law of Free Will

Gods have agreed to allow mortals to make their own decisions. Mortals cannot be controlled; merely influenced.

### Law of Balance

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only reshaped. Therefore, all magic comes with a price.

### Law of Travel

All travel between planes must be done through the Cosmic Railway, an interplanar transit system.

### Universal Tenets

- Gods cannot directly converse with one another and require proxies, such as champions or heralds.
- Mortals wishing to divine the future are subject to Loryssâ€™s mood on that day and may receive false information.
- Gods and mortals can copulate, but only after the proper courting of the god is attained.
- No gods can enter the Veilway.
- Life is a journey that ends in Lindiskard. Once the journey ends there is no return.
- An offering must be made before permittance to Umbradi.
- To break a bond with your god/patron is to risk death.
- Magic is finite throughout the universe; there must be a balance.
- Time is a river flowing in one direction.
